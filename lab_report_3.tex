This lab session aim is that students understand isobars and their relationship with wind speed,
identify various pressure systems and fronts on a weather chart, and 
interpret and produce plotted weather symbols. For the latter case  meteorology report codes, in
particular the SYNOP code, is presented. Students should
learn to encode a general weather situation to this code as well as to
interpret the code both graphically and as a short weather report.

\section{Introduction}
% is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather
% report is predominantly used by pilots in fulfillment of a part of a
% pre-flight weather briefing, and by meteorologists, who use
% aggregated METAR information to assist in weather forecasting.
Surface pressure charts show the surface pressure pattern using
\textit{isobars} (a particular kind of \textit{isopleths}, solid lines joining points of equal sea level pressure) and
indicate areas of high ($H$) and low pressure ($L$) along with their
central pressure value. High pressure is usually associated with
settled weather while low pressure is normally associated with
unsettled weather. 

In these charts fronts and other information of meteorological
interest can be also displayed. In particular, in the so called
\textit{synoptic charts} an extensive information about the state of
the atmosphere, usually reported with a graphical transcription of the SYNOP
code, is graphically encoded and represented.

SYNOP stands for \textit{surface SYNOPtic observation} and it is a
numerical code (called FM-12 by the World Meteorological Office
WMO\cite{FM-12}) that has been used for decades as the main way of
reporting and transmitting weather information. The observations could
be made by manned and automated weather stations.

The international SYNOP format has been used for real time
transmission of synoptic weather observations for about 50 years and
SYNOP reports are typically sent every six hours by Deutscher
Wetterdienst on shortwave and low frequency using RTTY. The
introduction of Internet made this redundant.

A report consists  of groups of five numbers (and slashes
where data are not  available) describing general weather information,
such  as  the temperature,  atmospheric  pressure, precipitation,  and
visibility at a weather station.

In most countries, SYNOP observations are made and transmitted each 3
hours at 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, and 2100 Universal
Time (UTC). There are two basic forms of land station surface synoptic
reports, one of which is the complete form and the other is the
shortened form. The complete form is referred to as the primary (or
main) synoptic, the 6-hourly report, or SYNOP. The primary synoptic is
reported at the standard hours of observation which are: 0000, 0600,
1200, and 1800 UTC. The shortened form is referred to as the
intermediate synoptic or the 3-hourly report.

The SYNOP code is very similar to a different code, the METAR. METAR
is an abbreviation of \textit{MÉTéorologique Aviation Régulière} and
is a report designed for aviation that could be issued from an
Automatic Weather Station (AWS) or a manned station. The METAR code is
also managed by the WMO. METARs usually carry less information aboutr
the weather than SYNOPs and are issued more frequently. In particular,
if conditions change significantly since the last METAR, a SPECI, or
specia weather report is produced. SPECIs are sent to report heavy
rain, sudden increase or direction change of wind, strong gusts, or
sudden temperature or visibility variations.

\section{Objectives}
The objectives of this lab session are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Students understand surface pressure maps and their relationship
  with wind speed.
\item Identify pressure systems and fronts on a synoptic weather
  chart.
\item Get acquainted with the SYNOP code to interpret and produce plotted
  weather symbols.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Isobars, pressure and winds}
Isobar lines join points of equal pressure, in a similar way to height
contours, on weather charts. Charts showing isobars help to identify
anticyclones (high atmospheric pressure areas) and depressions or
cyclones (low pressure areas). Pressure is measured in
millibars\footnote{Remember: \SI{1}{mb} = \SI{1}{hPa}} and isobars are
normally drawn at intervals of $\Delta p = \SI{4}{mb}$. Pressure
values are corrected to Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) before being
plotted on a map, this ensures that altitude does not affect the
mapping.

Drawing isobars in a map it is important to take into account the
following considerations.

\begin{itemize}
\item Each map point can only be associated with one isobar, thus
  isobar lines never cross. 
\item Isobar lines are continuous, forming loops or terminationg in the
  map edges, but never branch or terminate in a certain point.
\item A particular sense can be given to an isobar considering that
  the pressure sould grow to the right of the given sense.
\end{itemize} 

Isobars are also helpful because their distribution helps us to
understand the direction and strength of wind in a particular
location. Where isobars are \textit{close together}, for example near
a low pressure area, they indicate \textit{strong} winds. Where the
isobars are more \textit{widely spaced}, e.g.\ near an anticyclone,
they indicate \textit{light} winds.

Wind blows almost parallel to the isobars. Around a high pressure area
(an anticyclone) winds  blow clockwise and slightly across the isobars, away from
the centre of the anticyclone. In low pressure zones, wind blows
anticlockwise slightly across the isobars towards the centre of the low pressure.

\textit{Buys Ballot’s law} states that if you stand with your back to
the wind in the northern Hemisphere, low pressure will be on your
left. With the help of this law that you can work out the wind direction at different
locations on a weather chart.

There are several features of weather chart that can be easily
identified.

An \textit{anticyclone}, also known as a ‘high’ can be identified on a
weather chart as an (often large) area of widely spaced isobars, where
pressure is higher than surrounding area and the highest pressure
occurs at the center which is known as the ‘high pressure
center’. Anticyclones can bring warm and sunny weather in summer, but
cold and foggy weather in winter. In association with anticyclones,
\textit{ridges} are elongated extensions of areas of high
pressure. They bring similar weather to that associated with
anticyclones.

A \textit{cyclone}, also known as a depression or a ‘low’ can be recognised on a weather
chart by an area of closely spaced isobars, often in a roughly
circular shape, where pressure is lower than surrounding areas. They
are often accompanied by fronts. The lowest pressure occurs at the
'low pressure center', in the middle of a depression. Cyclones are
often associated with strong winds and heavy rain and are nearly
always accompanied by fronts. Associated with cyclones,
\textit{troughs} are elongated extensions of areas of low
pressure and bring similar weather to that associated with
depressions. 


\textit{Cold fronts} can be identified on weather charts as bold lines
with triangles. These are blue when displayed on colour charts. The
points of the triangle indicate the direction in which the front is
moving. A cold front indicates a change in air mass, where warmer air
is being replaced by colder air. They often bring short spells of
heavy rainfall in the form of showers and squally winds, and are
accompanied by a decrease in temperature, a veer in wind direction and
a change to brighter showery conditions. 

\textit{Warm fronts} can be identified on weather charts as bold lines
with semi-circles or humps. These are coloured red when displayed on
colour charts. The direction of the humps indicates the direction in
which the front is moving. A warm front indicates a change from a
colder to a warmer air mass. They often bring spells of prolonged and
sometimes heavy rainfall, with strong winds. 

The warm sector of a depression is located behind the warm front and
ahead of the cold front. It often brings mild temperatures but the
weather can be overcast with drizzle.

\textit{Occluded fronts} can be identified on weather charts as bold
lines with sets of triangles and semi-circles. These are coloured
purple on coloured weather charts. The direction in which the symbols
face indicates the direction in which the front is
travelling. Occlusions are formed when the cold front overtakes the
warm front, therefore they have similar characteristics to a cold
front, but less intense.

Other features of interest are \textit{troughs} and \textit{cols}.
\textit{Troughs} are lines of low
pressure, high vorticity, clouds, and possible precipitation, wind
shift and confluence. They often do not possess the strong horizontal
gradientes of temperature and moisture that characterize fronts. \textit{Cols} can be identified as an area of slack pressure between two anticyclones and two depressions.


\section{Synop Code Description}

The general syntax of the SYNOP code is as follows
\begin{align*}
&IIiii \text{ or } IIIII\; YYGGi_w\; 99LLL\; QLLLL\\
&i_Ri_XhVV\; Nddff\; 00fff\; 1sTTT\; 2sTTT\; 3PPPP\; 4PPPP\; 5appp\; 6RRRt\; 7wwW_1W_2\; 8NC_LC_MC_H\; 9GGgg\\
&222Dv\; 0sTTT\; 1PPHH\; 2PPHH\; 3dddd\; 4PPHH\; 5PPHH\; 6IEER\; 70HHH\; 8aTTT\\
&333\; 0....\; 1sTTT\; 2sTTT\; 3Ejjj\; 4Esss\; 5jjjj\; jjjjj\; 6RRRt\; 7RRRR\; 8Nchh\; 9SSss
\end{align*}

Very few reports will use all of the groups. For example, only at a coastal station would the section 222 (wave
information) be included, and even that station might not include all of the groups in the 222
section. Also, individual groups may be left out of an observation for a number of reasons.
Different regions may have requirements which will include groups or exclude groups,
principally in section 333.


There are four main groups:

\subsection{222 Group:  Sea Surface Observations}

This is a more specialized field that will not be covered in the present lab session.

\subsection{333 Group:  Special/Climatological Data}

This is a more specialized field that will not be covered in the present lab session.

\subsection{Example of a SYNOP code interpretation}

This example starting point is the following SYNOP code:

\begin{displaymath}
AAXX\;08383\;08181\;12580\;21212\;10248\;20093\;49175\;55006\;60002\;81201
\end{displaymath}

The interpretation of the given report is as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item{$IIiii = 08383$}: Location of the station, $08$ means Spain and
    $383$ means Huelva. You can check this online at \cite{stindex}.
   \item{$YYGGi_w = 08181$}: Data taken on the 8-th day of the month at
     $18.00$ with wind given in \si{m.s^{-1}} units from anenometer.
   \item{$i_Ri_XhVV = 12580$}: $i_R = 1$ means that precipitation is
     reported in group 1, $i_X = 2$ means that the station is manned
     and that no present/past weather is reported because of no
     significant changes. $h= 5$ means that lowest clouds appear at
     heights 600 to 1000 m. Finally $VV = 80$ means that minimum visibility
     extends to \SI{30}{km}.
   \item{$Nddff = 21212$}: $N = 2$ means that two eigths of the sky is
     covered by clouds, $dd = 12$ means that wind is from south east
     (SE, 120$^\circ$), and $ff=12$ means that wind speed is
     $v = \SI{12}{m.s^{-1}} = 12*1.94 = \SI{23}{knots}$.
   \item{$1sTTT = 10248$}: $s = 0$, positive temperature; $TTT = 248$,
     temperature $T = \SI{24.8}{\gc}$. 
   \item{$2sTTT = 20093$}: $s = 0$, positive dewpoint temperature; $TTT = 093$,
     temperature $\tau = \SI{9.3}{\gc}$. 
   \item{$4PPPP = 49175$}: $PPPP=9175$, station pressure $p = \SI{917.5}{hPa}$. 
   \item{$5appp = 55006$}: $a = 5$, pressure tendency since last
     report is decreasing, then increasing with a lower resultant
     pressure; $ppp = 006$ stands for a $\Delta p = \SI{0.6}{hPa}$ in
     last three hours.
   \item{$6RRRt = 60002$}: $RRR = 0$ stands for no precipitation and
     $t = 2$ during last 12 hours.
   \item{$8NC_LC_MC_H = 81201$}: $N = 1$ means than 1 eigth of the sky
     is covered with low altitude clouds and $C_LC_MC_H = 201$ means
     that low clouds are \textit{towering cumulus}, that there are no
     middle clouds, and that high clouds are \textit{cirrus}.
   \end{description}

\section{Graphical Representation}

Synoptic maps use a simple graphical representation to easily convey
the information in a condensed way. The way the information is
arranged can be found in figure \ref{circle_synop}. The center of
the plot is a circle for manned stations or a triangle for automatic stations.

The conventional symbols used for cloud cover, pressure trend, past weather, and cloud types in this representation can be found in figure \ref{fig_synop_symbols_1}. The wind speed and present weather graphical codification are included in figures \ref{circle_synop} and \ref{fig_synop_symbols_3}.

The graphical encoding of the example given in the previous subsection
is the following:

\section{Exercisess}
\paragraph{Exercise 1}
Given the sea level pressure field in the map represented in the figure
draw the associated isobar lines. 

\paragraph{Exercise 2}
Given the surface pressure chart represented in figure
\ref{map_ex2} fill the given table and find and label the following items:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Cold front &	Col& Warm front\\
Trough     &Occlusion&	High pressure center\\
Low pressure trough&	Low pressure center& High pressure ridge\\
Warm sector & & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
